# ESP8266 WiFi module

# Communication

There are three ways to communicate with the ESP8266

1. Direct USB: Connect directly via USB and communicate from your computer. This requires that you connect the ESP8266 to a FTDI. [I Used the FTDI Basic 3.3V from SparkFun](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9873). Check out the ESP2866_USB.png to see how the two are connected.
2. Microcontroller
3. OnBoard
